# Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction Case Study

## Introduction
This case study demonstrates the application of **linear regression** in a real business scenario for a bike-sharing provider, **BoomBikes**. The goal of this analysis is to model the demand for shared bikes based on various available independent variables. The insights derived from the model will help the management understand how the demand for bikes varies with different factors. This can enable the company to adjust its business strategy to meet demand levels and customer expectations. Additionally, the model can serve as a tool for BoomBikes to understand the demand dynamics in a new market.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning
During the data exploration phase, we identified and removed several columns that did not contribute to the business goals of the analysis. These columns were:
- `instant`
- `dteday`
- `casual`
- `registered`

These columns were dropped to streamline the analysis and focus on the relevant features.

Additionally, some categorical columns in the dataset held values in numerical form. To improve the clarity and interpretability of the data, these columns were converted to their appropriate categorical representations based on the data dictionary. For instance, the `weekday` feature was assumed to represent the days of the week as 0-6 (Sunday-Saturday).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization
During the EDA phase, we visualized and analyzed both categorical and continuous variables in the dataset. Here are some of the key findings:

- **Temperature (`temp` and `atemp`)**: Most days have temperatures between 10-30Â°C. The distributions of `temp` and `atemp` are almost identical, indicating they represent similar information.
- **Humidity**: The humidity levels on most days range between 50-80%.
- **Wind Speed**: The wind speed is mostly distributed between 5-20 km/h.
- **Bike Rental Demand**: The total count of rented bikes is **normally distributed** with a mean value between 4000-5000 rentals.

## Key Insights and Conclusion
From the data exploration and visualization, we observed the following:

- **High Demand on Warm Days**: The demand for bikes is higher on days with pleasant weather, particularly when the temperature is high. This suggests that the company should focus on optimizing operations during warmer months to meet customer demand.
  
- **Business Strategy Recommendations**:
  - **Summer Promotions**: The company could consider offering promotions or discounts during the summer months to attract more customers and increase rental counts.
  - **Bike Availability**: It is crucial for BoomBikes to ensure there is enough availability of bikes during peak seasons (e.g., summer) to fulfill the higher demand.
